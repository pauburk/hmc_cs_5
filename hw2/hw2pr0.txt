I was most struck by the human players reaction: Mr. Jennings said "I had a great time and I would do it again in a heartbeat," and both players said that Watson's advantage in speedy button pushing was in fact, not necessarily an unfair advantage. When I think of AI beating humans at games, I generally don't think that the humans are super happy about it. But then when I think about the situation I guess it seems more reasonable - I mean everybody can acknowledge that Google is pretty much the best source of random information. Google would be pretty hard to compete against!

I also saw a connection to the previous reading we did, where it was talking about how not needing causation for models. I think when Watson guesses Toronto for a U.S. city is a good example of this - Toronto is obviously not the answer because it is in Canada, but it fits the data well (or at least Watson thinks so).
